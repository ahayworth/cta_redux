    # Find a {CTA::Trip} that should be happening, given a timestamp and a route or run.
    # The CTA does not return GTFS trip_id information in either the BusTracker or TrainTracker API, so
    # it is actually somewhat difficult to associate an API response to a {CTA::Trip}. However, we
    # know what *should* be happening at any given time. This method attempts a fuzzy find - internally,
    # we often first try to find the exact Trip that should be happening according to the schedule, and
    # then failing that we assume that the CTA is running late and look for trips that should have
    # ended within the past 90 minutes. This almost always finds something.
    # That said, however, it means we may sometimes find a {CTA::Trip} that's incorrect. In practical usage
    # however, that doesn't matter too much - most Trips for a run service the same stops.
    # However, to be safe, your program may wish to compare certain other bits of the API responses to ensure
    # we found something valid. For example, almost all Brown line trains service the same stops, so
    # finding the wrong Trip doesn't matter too much. However, a handful of Brown line runs throughout the dat
    # actually change to Orange line trains at Midway - so, you may wish to verify that the destination of the
    # Trip matches the reported destination of the API.
    # Suggestions on how to approach this problem are most welcome (as are patches for better behavior).
    # @param [String] run The run or route to search for
    # @param [DateTime, String] timestamp The timestamp to search against.
    # @param [true,false] fuzz Whether or not to do an exact schedule search or a fuzzy search.
